# Welcome to SpacePhyML

SpacePhyML is a framework for working with space physics datasets. It aims to bring togheter already existing datasets for ease of usage and enable the simple creation of new datasets in the future. It is built on the torch dataset class but can be used in Tensorflow.

## Automatics in Space Exploration (ASAP)

The ASAP project is dedicated to designing and developing advanced algorithms that leverage artificial intelligence to automate onboard operations for space missions. These algorithms are specifically tailored for implementation on onboard processors, enhancing the efficiency, autonomy, and reliability of space systems. By integrating AI techniques, the project aims to reduce manual intervention, optimize mission performance, and enable smarter decision-making in real-time operational scenarios.
