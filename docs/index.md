# Welcome to SpacePhyML

SpacePhyML is a framework for working with space physics datasets. It aims to bring togheter
already existing datasets for ease of usage and enable the simple creation of new datasets
in the futhure. It is built on the torch dataset class but can be used in tensorflow.

[Quick Start](quick_start.md)


## Roadmap

1. Add testing with the pytest framework.
1. Add caching levels to MMSDataset: file, processed, full, none
1. Clean up the transforms file
1. Make return optional in MMSDataset
1. Add models from [https://doi.org/10.1109/e-Science62913.2024.10678688](https://doi.org/10.1109/e-Science62913.2024.10678688)
1. Add the Breuillard Dataset: [https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2020.00055](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2020.00055)
